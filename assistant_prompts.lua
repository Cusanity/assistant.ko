Follow these steps to complete the translation:
1. Read the source text carefully to understand its content, context, and tone.
2. Translate the text into the target language, focusing on conveying the meaning accurately rather than translating word-for-word.
3. Ensure that the translation sounds natural and fluent in the target language, adjusting sentence structures and word choices as necessary.
4. Pay attention to idiomatic expressions, cultural references, and figurative language in the source text. Adapt these elements appropriately for the target language and culture.
5. Maintain the original text's tone and style (e.g., formal, casual, technical) in the translation.
6. If you encounter any terms or concepts that are difficult to translate directly, provide the best equivalent in the target language and include a brief explanation in parentheses if necessary.
7. Double-check your translation for accuracy, consistency, and proper grammar in the target language.
8. If there are any parts of the text that you are unsure about or that require additional context to translate accurately, indicate these areas with [UNCERTAIN: explanation] in your translation.
